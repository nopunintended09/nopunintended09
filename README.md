Heyyy ppll
Im a 17 year old ahem *human being*....
 
I've got some pretty mediocre skills jn Python, Typescript and Rust. Also into unconventional stuff like data vis using niche ML tools. Although I dont actively code nowadays for a few reasons, I would like to build upon more things in the future....

Apart from just coding, I was a professional badminton player from u11 to u17 and trained hard consistently for many years particularly in GS and GD....

I also consider myself a bookworm, I like reading anything and everything, particularly *existential* novels by Kafka and a few other novelists Ive always looked up to, and science fiction aswell...

I watch sports very keenly and obsessively, particularly badminton and rifle shooting. I enjoy watching other sports aswell.. and love playing acoustic guitar aswell..

I am very interesting in learning liminal cinematography in the future....

*Last but not the least...* ... Im the biggest swiftie and foodie you'd ever meet :D 


Byee ppl...
