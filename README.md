Heyyy ppll Im a 17 year old ahem human being....

I've got some pretty mediocre skills jn **Python**, **Typescript**, and **Rust**. Also into unconventional stuff like **data vis using niche ML tools** like **Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees** and libraries such as **Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, AstroPy**. Although I dont actively code nowadays for a few reasons, I would like to build upon more skills in the future....

Apart from just coding, I was a professional **badminton player from u11 to u17** and trained hard consistently for many years particularly in **GS and GD**....

I also consider myself a **bookworm**, I like reading anything and everything, particularly existential novels by Kafka and a few other novelists Ive always looked up to, and science fiction aswell...

I watch sports very keenly and obsessively, particularly **badminton** and **rifle shooting**. I enjoy watching other sports aswell.. and also love playing **acoustic guitar** ..

I am very interested in learning **liminal cinematography** in the future....

Last but not the least... ... Im the biggest **swiftie** and **foodie** you'd ever meet :D
