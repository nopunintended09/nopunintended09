Hiiiii
Im a 17 year old *human being*
Ive got mediocre skills in python, typescript and rust which I would like to build upon in the future. I am also interested in data vis using niche ML tools and got some google colab projects aswell.

Apart from just coding, I was also a professional badminton player from u11 to u17 and trained hard for years. 

I consider myself a bookworm and like to read everything and anything. I like *existential* novels by Kafka and a few other novelists, and like to read science fiction. I also like to play acoustic guitar allot. 

I love watching sports, particularly badminton and rifle shooting..and some other sports. 

I am also very keen to learn cinematography and liminal art in the future

Also im the biggest swiftie you'd prolly ever meet :D
